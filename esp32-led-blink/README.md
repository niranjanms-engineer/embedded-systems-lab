# ESP32 LED Control

A basic embedded systems project to control an LED using ESP32 GPIO pins.

## Objective
To understand digital output control and basic firmware development on the ESP32.

## Hardware Used
- ESP32 Development Board
- LED
- 220Ω resistor
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Software Used
- Arduino IDE
- ESP32 Arduino Core

## Description
The program configures a GPIO pin as output and toggles an LED state. This project serves as a foundation for learning GPIO control and embedded firmware structure.

## Status
Completed – basic LED ON/OFF control
